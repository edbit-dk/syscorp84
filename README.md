# FALLHACK

FALLHACK is a retro web-simulation of a stylized ARPANET/MILNET, circa 1984, a transcontinental network operated by the US Military.

It is a full multi-user simulation, including simulated hosts. The simulation takes inspiration from "Fallout", "TeleHack" , "Hacknet" and other terminal-focused games. 

The main focus of the project is to educate about internet and terminal history and technology.

# Fallout inspiration 
- UOS = U/OS (Unified Operating System)
- ZAX = VAX/OS (Virtual Advanced eXecution Operating System)
- The Enclave = The SysCorp Syndicate (SCS) 
- IBM = International Data Machines Corp. (IDM)
- Vault-Tec = Corporate Security Systems Corp. (COP-SEC / CSC)
- RobCo = Robot & Computer Industries (RobCom Ind. / RCI)
- General Atomics + Poseidon Energy = General Energy Company Corp. (GEC)
- PoseidoNET = DEFCOM-NET, GEC-NET, NEURAL-NET, SYSCORP-NET
- West-Tek = Defense & Communications Industries (DEF-COM / DFC)
- Repconn =  Space HeliX Industries (SpaceH Ind.) 
- The Calculator = The Colossus
- The Institute = Control & Automation Institute (CAI)

# World Structure 
UNITED SYSTEMS OF CORPORATIONS (USC)
- SCS (SYSCORP-NET) - ADMIN/BOARD
- CAI (VAX/OS, Colossus, NEURAL-NET) - R&D
- CSC (CAI, VAX/OS, COPSEC-NET) - POLICE/SECURITY 
- DFC (VAX/OS, DEFCOM-NET) - MILITARY/TECH 
- GEC (IDM, SpaceH, U/OS, RobCom, GEC-NET) - ENERGY/INDUSTRY/INFRASTRUCTURE
