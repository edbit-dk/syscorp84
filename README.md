# SysCorp84

SysCorp84 is a retro web-simulation of a stylized ARPANET/MILNET, circa 1984, a transcontinental network operated by the US Military.

It is a full multi-user simulation, including simulated hosts. The simulation takes inspiration from "Fallout", "TeleHack" , "Hacknet" and other terminal-focused games. 

The main focus of the project is to educate about internet and terminal history and technology.
