# FALLHACK

FALLHACK is a retro web-simulation of a stylized ARPANET/MILNET, circa 1984, a transcontinental network operated by the US Military.

It is a full multi-user simulation, including simulated hosts. The simulation takes inspiration from "Fallout", "TeleHack" , "Hacknet" and other terminal-focused games. 

The main focus of the project is to educate about internet and terminal history and technology.

# Fallout inspiration 
- UOS = V/OS (Virtual Operating System)
- ZAX = VAX/OS (Virtual Advanced eXecution Operating System)
- Maineframe = MV/OS (Mainframe Virtual Operating System)
- The Enclave = The SysCorp Syndicate (SCS) 
- IBM = International Data Machines (IDM Corp)
- Vault-Tec = Control & Security Systems (Con-Sec Corp - CSC)
- RobCo = Robot & Computer Industries (RobCom Industries)
- General Atomics + Poseidon Energy = General Energy Company Group (GEC Corp)
- PoseidoNET = DEFCOM-NET, GEC-NET, NEURAL-NET, SYSCORP-NET
- West-Tek = Defense & Communications Solutions (DEF-COM)
- Repconn =  Space HeliX Ventures (SpaceH) 
- The Calculator = The Colossus

# World Structure 
SCS (SYSCORP-NET)
- AI (VAX/OS, cAI, NEURAL-NET)
- CON-SEC (cAI, VAX/OS, CONSEC-NET)
- DEF-COM (VAX/OS, DEFCOM-NET)
- GEC (IDM, SPACEH, (M)V/OS, ROBCOM, GEC-NET,)
