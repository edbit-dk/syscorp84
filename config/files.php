        The state is no longer an institution of people, but an algorithm of profit. When the USOC (Unified Systems of Corporations) controls your light (GEC), your security (DEFCON), and your thoughts (SYSCORP), you no longer exist as a citizen. You are a 'resource.'
        Hacking is not a crime against property. It is an act of demogracy. To break into their mainframes is to remind the machine that there was once a world before 1975, where silence was not monitored and where data was not god.
        We are the ones left behind - the fall outcasts. We are the ones living in the dead nodes. We are the flaw in the system that refuses to be fixed!",
